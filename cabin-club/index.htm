                        Cabin Club (based in South Carolina) is composed of wife and husband, Sheridan and Rob Burgos, and wife and husband,
                        Kayla and Andrew Parker.  Managed by Kayla and Andrew's eleven year old daughter, Aria, the
                        band formed last summer in the Parker's garage.  The band has had riveting success
                        and now moved to the room over the garage in a house down the street.  
                    </p><p>
                        The foursome (no polyamory reference intended) all met in high school back when boys wearing
                        black eyeliner and girls wearing black choker neckalaces was cool (the first time).
                        They knew the band was meant to be when they bumped into each other one summer at the 
                        Warped Tour and realized they were all simultaneously (and ironically) singing along
                        to Blink 182s "Rock Show".
                    </p><p>
                        The band's name developed from a trip the group took to a cabin in North Carolina, 
                        where they lounged in a hot tub while eating spaghetti, binging on wine, and conjuring 
                        up a way to get famous. Thus, Cabin Club was born.
                        Influenced by the emotional lyrics of Dashboard Confessional, layered vocals of Taking Back 
                        Sunday, male/female duo vocalists like Fleetwood Mac, and pop powerhouses like Demi Lovato, 
                        the band strives to make a sound uniquely their own.
