		<h2>who am i?</h2>
		<p>
		an almost 29-year-old non-traditional student in the midst of earning a bachelor's degree in 
		information technology with a concentration in software engineering. 
		 <i>concentration</i> is the key word because i am 
		 much more interested in full-stack development and the world of code than i am in networks,
		 cables, or how to operate a switch.  however, i'll learn it all and become a proverbial
		 jill-of-all-trades because, why not?  i'm here to be a sponge of everything i can fit into
		  my brain in 2 years.
		</p>
		<p>
		all online is also a key word because we move...a LOT.  i absolutely love it: traveling the country,
		experiencing new things, and always staying on my toes.  i've also become very versatile in
		job skills because of this, as you may notice from my <a href="resume.htm">resume</a>.  from 
		teaching to dental assisting,
		housekeeping to nannying, even to a brief stint in woodworking, my job has been determined
		by the moves we have made for my wife's career.  this doesn't stop me, i passionately learn as much
		as i can to be the best at every job i perform.  and with this decision to go back to school
		i'm putting an investment in my future career: one that has a market everywhere, one that is
		universal, one that has no limits, and one that i can participate in from any point on the globe
		(with Internet access).
		</p>
		<p>
		while job experience may be something i lack, i make up for it in multitudes with unparalleled
		drive and determination.  i go above and beyond for any task i pursue.  i do my best not to
		simply learn new skills, but master them, engulfing information and being able to 
		perform with expertise, creativity, and strong attention to detail.
		</p>
		<p>
		while this was a little background on where i stand professionally, find out more about
		 me personally <a href="home.htm">here</a> or <a href="interests.htm">here</a>.
