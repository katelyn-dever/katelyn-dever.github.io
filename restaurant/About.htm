		<p>
		<br>
			At Super Restaurant, the freshest ingredients are always our priority.  For that reason, 
			we farm 80% of our own ingredients.  That's right, <span class="name">WE GROW THE FOOD</span>.  
			We own the farm,
			grow the produce, and pick it only when it's reached perfection.  The other 20%? All locally
			grown, right here in Macon, GA.  Nothing we serve to you will be anything less than the peak
			of freshness, we gaurantee it.
